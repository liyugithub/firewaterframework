To Do:
  * integrate new Spring 2.5 security stuff (nee Acegi Security)
  * handle multi-part POSTs to temporary files
  * JythonMapper - allow web services to be scripted in Jython (or Ruby?)
  * custom Spring 2.5 Firewater XML schema
  * start on intellij plug-in
  * FirewaterMVC - why not use Firewater + StringTemplate + Jython for MVC stuff?
  * PivotTreeBuilder improvements - better collections
  * remove Dom4J dependencies - one less dependency is always a good thing (use native Java XML libs)
  * ThreadPoolMapper - a mapper that manages a fixed set of sub-Mappers for memory intensive web service operations (eg. mixing down an MP3 or resizing an image)
  * ImageMapper - a mapper that can perform a number of image processing operations
  * MailMergeMapper - a mapper that merges a StringTemplate mail template and sends it out with JavaMail
  * Example - we need a better example application - Pet Clinic?
  * integrate the XMLVerbatim XSL transformation for all document output
  * relationships in result documents are currently ad-hoc - is there a Resource abstraction that could represent link URLs in results documents?
