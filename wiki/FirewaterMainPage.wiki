= Firewater =

The goal of this project is to provide a framework to create highly efficient and powerful Web Service APIs.

Firewater embraces the [RestPage REST] web service architecture.  This approach fully leverages existing HTTP architecture and concepts to provide operations (create, replace, fetch, update, delete, for example) on application Resources.
